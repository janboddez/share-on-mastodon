Automatically share WordPress posts on Mastodon.

== Description ==
Automatically share WordPress posts on [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/).

You choose which post types are shared, and sharing can still be disabled on a per-post basis.

Supports WordPress' new block editor, image uploads and alt text, "template tags," and comes with a number of filter hooks for developers.

More details can be found on [this plugin's web page](https://jan.boddez.net/wordpress/share-on-mastodon).
